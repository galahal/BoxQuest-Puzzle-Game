# BoxQuest-Puzzle-Game-
A maze where a player will guide a lone box from a starting point to the goal while minimizing our move count. We will use the left right up down keys to move our player. We will be able to restart the game and also close the game. We will have to move our box to the goal within the move count as well as the time limit.
